# geobuf

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mapbox/geobuf.png)](http://travis-ci.org/mapbox/geobuf)

A [compact encoding](geobuf.proto) for geographic data.

Like [vector-tile-spec](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec),
this is a [protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf/)-based encoding.

Unlike vector-tile-spec, this deals with untiled data in native projections.

## API

### `featureCollectionToGeobuf(geojson)`

Given a GeoJSON FeatureCollection as an object, return a Buffer of
geobuf as a [ProtoBufjs](https://github.com/dcodeIO/ProtoBuf.js) object.

### `featureToGeobuf(geojson)`

Given a GeoJSON Feature as an object, return a Buffer of
geobuf as a [ProtoBufjs](https://github.com/dcodeIO/ProtoBuf.js) object.

### `geobufToFeature(buf)`

Given a Buffer of geobuf, return a GeoJSON Feature as an object.

### `geobufToFeatureCollection(buf)`

Given a Buffer of geobuf, return a GeoJSON FeatureCollection as an object.

## Binaries

    npm install -g geobuf

Installs these nifty binaries:

* `geobuf2geojson`: turn geobuf from stdin to geojson on stdout
* `geojson2geobuf`: turn geojson from stdin to geobuf on stdout
* `shp2geobuf`: given a shapefile filename, send geobuf on stdout

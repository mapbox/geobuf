Geobuf is a compact binary encoding for geographic data.

Geobuf provides _lossless_ compression of GeoJSON data
into [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/).
Advantages over using GeoJSON alone:

- **Very compact**: typically makes GeoJSON 6-8 times smaller.
- 2-2.5x smaller even when comparing gzipped sizes.
- **Very fast encoding and decoding** &mdash; even faster than native JSON parse/stringify.
- Can accommodate any GeoJSON data, including extensions with arbitrary properties.

The [encoding format](geobuf.proto) also potentially allows:

- Easy **incremental parsing** &mdash; get features out as you read them,
without the need to build in-memory representation of the whole data.
- **Partial reads** &mdash; read only the parts you actually need, skipping the rest.

Think of this as an attempt to design a simple, modern Shapefile successor
that works seamlessly with GeoJSON.
Unlike [Mapbox Vector Tiles](https://github.com/mapbox/vector-tile-spec/),
it aims for _lossless_ compression of datasets &mdash; without tiling, projecting coordinates,
flattening geometries or stripping properties.

Note that the encoding schema is **not stable yet** &mdash;
it may still change as we get community feedback and discover new ways to improve it.


#### Sample compression sizes

                    | normal    | gzipped
------------------- | --------- | --------
us-zips.json 	    | 101.85 MB | 26.67 MB
us-zips.pbf         | 12.24 MB  | 10.48 MB
idaho.json          | 10.92 MB  | 2.57 MB
idaho.pbf           | 1.37 MB   | 1.17 MB

## API

### encode

```js
var buffer = geobuf.encode(geojson, new Pbf());
```

Given a GeoJSON object and a [Pbf](https://github.com/mapbox/pbf) object to write to,
returns a Geobuf as a `Buffer` object in Node or `UInt8Array` object in browsers.

### decode

```js
var geojson = geobuf.decode(new Pbf(data));
```

Given a [Pbf](https://github.com/mapbox/pbf) object with Geobuf data, return a GeoJSON object.


## Install

Node and Browserify:

```bash
npm install geobuf
```

Making a browser build:

```bash
npm install
npm run build-dev # dist/geobuf-dev.js (development build)
npm run build-min # dist/geobuf.js (minified production build)
```


## Command Line

```bash
npm install -g geobuf
```

Installs these nifty binaries:

* `geobuf2json`: turn Geobuf from `stdin` or specified file to GeoJSON on `stdout`
* `json2geobuf`: turn GeoJSON from `stdin` or specified file to Geobuf on `stdout`
* `shp2geobuf`: given a Shapefile filename, send Geobuf on `stdout`

```bash
json2geobuf data.json > data.pbf
shp2geobuf myshapefile > data.pbf
geobuf2json data.pbf > data.json
```

Note that for big files, `geobuf2json` command can be pretty slow, but the bottleneck is not the decoding,
but the native `JSON.stringify` on the decoded object to pipe it as a string to `stdout`.
On some files, this step may take 40 times more time than actual decoding.
